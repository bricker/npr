        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[Back in 1986, a skinny 17-year-old Porter went on trial there as an adult for robbing a post office at gunpoint. His sentence: 35 years.]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Porter served 15 years. When released in 2001, he radically changed his life and enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis while still on probation.

        <paragraph num="10"><![CDATA[Today, Porter works with a group of ex-offenders in an intense seven-month-long program that he helped design. The ex-felons are required to do community service, look for a job and participate in therapy.

        <paragraph num="13"><![CDATA["Did it serve our interest to lock him up? Or did it serve our interest to get him clean? Because if he's clean, we don't have to worry about him knocking somebody in the head for a shot of dope," Porter says.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="14"><![CDATA[Lamont McGhee served 13 years in prison for drug conspiracy. He went through Porter's program and admits that Porter's job isn't an easy one.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="15"><![CDATA["He's got to put up with a lot of knuckleheads. He's got to put up with a lot of people that's not going to listen," McGhee says. "A lot of people that say he's one of them, meaning a probation officer."]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA["There are some mentoring programs here or there, but there's no systematic development of this sort of program," she says. "But this is something that I hear from offenders — that this is something that they want, that they need."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="18"><![CDATA[Because of their success, Burris and Porter speak to groups across the country. Burris beams when recalling the time he sent Porter to attend a regional White House meeting.]]></paragraph>

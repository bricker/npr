Shankar's goal to make Eastern music known in the West was achieved with help from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15229570" target="_blank">The Beatles</a>, though he grew discouraged by the hippie scene, where drugs clouded the attention of his audience.</p>   <p>Back in India, Shankar wrote sitar concerts for Western symphony orchestras and continued touring. The composer and performer remained a teacher too. In December of 2004, when I visited his home in New Delhi, the sitar master was still giving lessons. He sat on the carpeted floor in an old brown sweater vest playing simple exercises; his sitar filled the room with feeling.</p>   <p>"[This music] is sort of is a combination of <em>shanta</em> and <em>karuna</em>, which means tranquility and sadness," he said of the piece he was playing. "This sadness is ... like wanting to reach out [for something] and not finding it, whether for a lover or for God."</p>   <p>Shankar's music reached out to some of the West's finest musicians. Violinist Yehudi Menuhin and composer <a href="http://www.npr.org/artists/15680178/philip-glass" target="_blank">Philip Glass</a> were friends and collaborators. One of today's top pop stars, Grammy winner <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15012277" target="_blank">Norah Jones</a>, is Shankar's daughter. Another daughter, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15402971" target="_blank">Anoushka</a>, learned sitar from her father, and now takes his classical tradition and makes it more contemporary.</p>   <p>A few winters ago in Delhi, remembering those demanding early years of sitar studies, Ravi Shankar said his guru's most important lesson was this: "He says that we have to earn our livelihood, and for that we have to perform and accept money. But music is not for sale. The music that I have learned and want to give is like worshiping God. It's absolutely like a prayer."</p>   <p>Shankar once said he felt ecstasy when he made music — the world was erased, and he experienced great peace. His music embraced and lifted those who heard and loved it, his widow Sukanya, his daughters and his many fans.</p>   <div id="res167020365" class="bucketwrap video youtube-video large graphic624">
